D044122, Receptor* Melatonin* MT1, 1, Melatonin: an endogenous miraculous indolamine, fights against cancer progression., PURPOSE: Melatonin is an amphipathic indolamine molecule ubiquitously present in all organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to humans. The pineal gland is the site of melatonin synthesis and secretion under the influence of the retinohypothalamic tract. Some extrapineal tissues (skin* lens* gastrointestinal tract* testis* ovary* lymphocytes* and astrocytes) also enable to produce melatonin. Physiologically* melatonin regulates various functions like circadian rhythm* sleep-wake cycle* gonadal activity* redox homeostasis* neuroprotection* immune-modulation* and anticancer effects in the body. Inappropriate melatonin secretion advances the aging process* tumorigenesis* visceral adiposity* etc. METHODS: For the preparation of this review* I had reviewed the literature on the multidimensional activities of melatonin from the NCBI website database PubMed* Springer Nature* Science Direct (Elsevier)* Wiley Online ResearchGate* and Google Scholar databases to search relevant articles. Specifically* I focused on the roles and mechanisms of action of melatonin in cancer prevention. RESULTS: The actions of melatonin are primarily mediated by G-protein coupled MT1 and MT2 receptors; however* several intracellular protein and nuclear receptors can modulate the activity. Normal levels of the melatonin protect the cells from adverse effects including carcinogenesis. Therapeutically* melatonin has chronomedicinal value; it also shows a remarkable anticancer property. The oncostatic action of melatonin is multidimensional* associated with the advancement of apoptosis* the arrest of the cell cycle* inhibition of metastasis* and antioxidant activity. CONCLUSION: The present review has emphasized the mechanism of the anti-neoplastic activity of melatonin that increases the possibilities of the new approaches in cancer therapy.

D000890, Anti-Infective Agents, 1, Influence of eugenol on algal growth, cell physiology of cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and its interaction with signaling molecules., Essential oils (EOs) are naturally occurring substances that have shown great prospect in the field of antimicrobial* antioxidant and pest control by nontoxic mechanisms. In this regard* EOs are considered the promising and eco-friendly approach for controlling harmful algae. In this study* the anti-cyanobacterial activity of EOs eugenol against Microcystis aeruginosa are evaluated from the perspective of photosynthetic efficiency* the behavior of extracellular organic matter (EOM)* endogenous plant hormone synthesis* and nitric oxide signaling pathway. Results showed that the photosynthetic activity of M. aeruginosa decreased significantly after eugenol treatments. Eugenol treatment resulted in cells rupture and the release of EOM. Levels of endogenous plant hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) were enhanced separately by 2.32 and 2.01 times after 4 d of exposure to eugenol. And the inhibition of SA and JA biosynthesis further promotes the inhibitory effects of eugenol on algae. Additionally* the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) increased significantly by 3.78-fold. Furthermore* the influence of NO on microalgae exposed to eugenol was also determined* suggesting that the inhibitory effect of eugenol stress might be associated with NO generation in M. aeruginosa. These findings will be helpful for the understanding of the fate and potential of eugenol in harmful algae control.

D010455, Peptides, 1, Inhibition of Extracellular Enzymes Exposed to Cyanopeptides., Harmful cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater ecosystems produce bioactive secondary metabolites including cyanopeptides that pose ecological and human health risks. Only adverse effects of one class of cyanopeptides* microcystins* have been studied extensively and have consequently been included in water quality assessments. Inhibition is a commonly observed effect for enzymes exposed to cyanopeptides and has mostly been investigated for human biologically relevant model enzymes. Here* we investigated the inhibition of ubiquitous aquatic enzymes by cyanobacterial metabolites. Hydrolytic enzymes are utilized in the metabolism of aquatic organisms and extracellularly by heterotrophic bacteria to obtain assimilable substrates. The ubiquitous occurrence of hydrolytic enzymes leads to the co-occurrence with cyanopeptides especially during cyanobacterial blooms. Bacterial leucine aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase were exposed to cyanopeptide extracts of different cyanobacterial strains (

D037621, Artemisinins, 1, Cell membrane damage induced by continuous stress of artemisinin sustained-release microspheres (ASMs) on Microcystis aeruginosa at different physiological stages., Artemisinin sustained-release microspheres (ASMs) with long-term inhibition effects (> 40 days) on harmful freshwater bloom-forming cyanobacteria have been found in previous studies* but the inhibition mechanism is not completely clear. In the present study* we examined the growth effect of ASMs on Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) cells at different physiological stages. Growth experiments indicated that M. aeruginosa of different initial densities could be inhibited immediately and chlorophyll-a content both showed significant decreases following exposure of cyanobacteria to optimal dosage of ASMs for 20 days. The algicidal mechanism of ASMs was tested through a suite of physiological parameters (membrane permeability* antioxidant enzymes activity* and lipid peroxidation). The rise of cell membrane permeability indices (intracellular protein* nucleic acid contents* and conductivity) showed that the cellular membrane structure of M. aeruginosa was attacked by ASMs directly causing the leakage of cytoplasm. Antioxidant enzyme activity was a sensitive indicator of the impacts of ASMs which showed a significant downtrend after a few days. ASMs caused a great increase in •O

In this study* we investigated GO toxicity to green algae (Chlorella vulgaris* Scenedesmus obliquus* Chlamydomonas reinhardtii)* cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) and diatoms (Cyclotella sp.). The aim was to assess how the physiological characteristics of algae affect the toxicity of GO. Results showed that 10 mg/L of GO significantly inhibited the growth of all tested algal types* while S. obliquus and C. reinhardtii were found to be the most susceptible and tolerant species* respectively. Then* scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the physiological characteristics of the assessed algae. The presence of locomotive organelles* along with smaller and more spherical cells* was more likely to alleviate the shading effect. Variations in cell wall composition led to different extents of mechanical damage as shown by Cyclotella sp. silica frustules and S. obliquus autosporine division being prone to damage. Meanwhile* growth inhibition and cell division were significantly correlated with the oxidative stress and membrane permeability* suggesting the latter two indicators can effectively signal GO toxicity to algae. The findings of this study provide novel insights into the toxicity of graphene materials in aquatic environments.

D001427, Bacterial Toxins, 2, Biochemical parameters in skin and muscle of Pelophylax kl. esculentus frogs: Influence of a cyanobacterial bloom in situ., There is little information in scientific literature as to how conditions created by a microcystin (MC) producing cyanobacterial bloom affect the oxidant/antioxidant* biotransformation and neurotoxicity parameters in adult frogs in situ. We investigated biochemical parameters in the skin and muscle of Pelophylax kl. esculentus from Lake Ludaš (Serbia) by comparing frogs that live on the northern bloom side (BS) of the lake with those that inhabit the southern no-bloom side (NBS). A higher protein carbonylation level and lower antioxidant defense system capability in the skin of frogs living in conditions of the cyanobacterial bloom were observed. Inhibition of glutathione-dependent machinery was the major mechanism responsible for the induction of cyanobacterial bloom-mediated oxidative stress in frog skin. On the other hand* the detected higher ability of muscle to overcome bloom prooxidant toxicity was linked to a higher efficiency of the biotransformation system through glutathione-S-transferase activity and/or was the consequence of indirect exposure of the tissue to the bloom. Our results have also revealed that the cyanobacterial bloom conditions induced the cholinergic neurotransmitter system in both tissues. This study provides a better understanding of the ecotoxicological impact of the MC producing cyanobacterial bloom on frogs in situ. However* further investigations of the complex mechanism involved in cyanobacterial bloom toxicity in real environmental conditions are required.

C057862, cyanoginosin LR, 1, Effects of microcystins-LR on genotoxic responses in human intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460)., Microcystin-LR (MC-LR)* a cyclic heptapeptide toxin produced by cyanobacteria* was found to induce genotoxic actions in various types of cells. Some investigators reported that microcystin-LR acted as tumor initiator in the observed genotoxic action mediated by this cyanotoxin. However* the underlying mechanisms underlying MC-induced DNA damage in the human intestine epithelium cell line (NCM460) are not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of 24 hr exposure to 5 or 10 µM MC-LR on intestinal DNA damage using NCM460 intestine cell line as a model. Data showed that MC-LR increased Olive tail moment (OTM) as evidenced by the comet assay* inhibited protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity* elevated reactive oxygen species levels (ROS) and enhanced γ-H2AX and 
D001599, Berberine, 1, Comparing effects of berberine on the growth and photosynthetic activities of Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella pyrenoidosa., Berberine is a potent algicidal allelochemical of Microcystis aeruginosa. To optimize its application in the control of Microcystis blooms* the effects of berberine on the growth and photosynthetic activities of M. aeruginosa and a non-target green alga* Chlorella pyrenoidosa* were compared. The results showed that the algicidal activity of berberine on M. aeruginosa was light dependent. Berberine had no algicidal effects on C. pyrenoidosa with or without light exposure. Under light-dark conditions* berberine significantly decreased the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in M. aeruginosa while no significant berberine-induced changes were observed under constant darkness. Significant reductions of photosystem II (PSII) and whole chain electron transport activities in M. aeruginosa exposed to berberine suggested that PSII was the important target site attacked by berberine. Contrary to M. aeruginosa* no berberine-induced inhibition in photosynthesis activities were observed in C. pyrenoidosa. The differences in photosynthetic apparatuses of these two algae might be responsible for their different sensitivities to berberine.
D012987, Soil, 1, Promoting desert biocrust formation using aquatic cyanobacteria with the aid of MOF-based nanocomposite., Desertification and eutrophication are two global environmental problems human beings face. Inoculating cyanobacteria to form biocrusts is considered an effective technology to inhibit desertification. The main limitation of biocrust formation is the lack of propagules and nutrients in deserts. A possible low cost source of propagules and nutrients is eutrophic water containing aquatic cyanobacteria (AC)* nitrogen and phosphorus. In this study* we fabricated a network-structured nanocomposite (designated as MC) using a metal-organic framework (MOF) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). MC* with a large specific surface area and numerous surface groups* had a high retention capacity for water and nutrients and good biosafety. The combination of AC-containing water (ACW) and MC could provide a suitable microenvironment in the soil* promote the growth of desert cyanobacteria (DC)* formation of biocrusts and inhibition of desertification. This study provides a novel approach to simultaneously relieve desertification and eutrophication.

D002220, Carbamazepine, 1, Carbamazepine toxicity and its co-metabolic removal by the cyanobacteria Spirulina platensis., Bioremediation of pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewater using microalgae has attracted increasing attention. Cyanobacteria* which are important prokaryotic microalgae* are widely distributed in different water environments* and have the advantages of simple culture and a fast growth rate. However* studies on either the toxicity of pharmaceutical contaminants (PhCs) to cyanobacteria or the removal of PhCs by cyanobacteria are scarce. In this study* carbamazepine (CBZ) and Spirulina platensis were selected as model PhCs and cyanobacteria* respectively. CBZ (>1 mg/L) had toxicity effects on S. platensis* showing maximal growth inhibition (34.0%) at 100 mg/L after 10 days of cultivation. At CBZ < 25 mg/L* S. platensis showed a trend similar to that of eukaryotic microalgae in increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and content of chlorophylls* carotenoids* carbohydrates* and lipids. These results indicated that S. platensis had a similar protective mechanism to CBZ toxicity as that of the eukaryotic microalgae. Increasing CBZ concentration (50-100 mg/L) significantly decreased these biochemical characteristics and photosynthetic activity owing to the serious damage of the structure and function of S. platensis. However* with increasing cultivation time* the growth and photosynthetic activity of S. platensis recovered from the toxicity of CBZ. S. platensis showed a maximum of 30.97 ± 1.30% removal of CBZ (1 mg/L)* mainly through biodegradation. Addition of 0.3 mg/L glucose enhanced this removal efficiency to 50.13 ± 2.51% via co-metabolism. These findings indicated that S. platensis can be used for the removal of CBZ or other PhCs from wastewater.
D009930, Organic Chemicals, 1, High-pressure jet-induced hydrodynamic cavitation as a pre-treatment step for avoiding cyanobacterial contamination during water purification., Due to specific physical properties* hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) is assigned to the powerful technologies for treating the biotic contamination in water including cyanobacteria. Contaminated water stream (CWS) can be cavitated directly by passing through some HC device* or indirectly when high-pressure jet stream (HPJS) is directed against its flow. Relatively small HPJS stream can thus treat a big volume of CWS in a short time or even work in continuous mode. Cyanobacteria floating in the CWS are forced to flow through the mixing cavitation zone. Within 2 h after single HC treatment* cyanobacterial cell suspensions showed disintegration of larger colonies and enhanced biomass sedimentation. Additional pre-treatment of CWS with low amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H

D010100, Oxygen, 2, A single plasmid based CRISPR interference in Synechocystis 6803 - A proof of concept., We developed a simple method to apply CRISPR interference by modifying an existing plasmid pCRISPathBrick containing the native S. pyogenes CRISPR assembly for Synechocystis PCC6803 and named it pCRPB1010. The technique presented here using deadCas9 is easier to implement for gene silencing in Synechocystis PCC6803 than other existing techniques as it circumvents the genome integration and segregation steps thereby significantly shortens the construction of the mutant strains. We executed CRISPR interference against well characterized photosynthetic genes to get a clear phenotype to validate the potential of pCRPB1010 and presented the work as a "proof of concept". Targeting the non-template strand of psbO gene resulted in decreased amount of PsbO and 50% decrease in oxygen evolution rate. Targeting the template strand of psbA2 and psbA3 genes encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) using a single spacer against the common sequence span of the two genes* resulted in full inhibition of both genes* complete abolition of D1 protein synthesis* complete loss of oxygen evolution as well as photoautotrophic growth arrest. This is the first report of a single plasmid based* completely lesion free and episomal expression and execution of CRISPR interference in Synechocystis PCC6803.

D006812, Humic Substances, 1, Effects of photochemical and microbiological changes in terrestrial dissolved organic matter on its chemical characteristics and phytotoxicity towards cyanobacteria., Previous studies have shown that under laboratory conditions* dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from plants can be differentially more phytotoxic to cyanobacteria* compared to green algae. This study examined how DOM source and transformation processes (microbial and photochemical) affect its chemical composition and phytotoxicity towards a cultured species of cyanobacteria (Raphidiopsis raciborskii) using a factorial experimental design. To complement cyanobacterial bioassays* the chemical composition and associated changes in DOM were determined using spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and absorbance) and elemental analyses. Sunlight exposed DOM from leaves of the terrestrial plants* Casuarina cunninghamiana and Eucalyptus tereticornis had the most phytotoxic effect compared to DOM not exposed to sunlight. This phytotoxic DOM was characterised by relatively low nitrogen content* containing highly coloured and relatively high molecular mass constituents. Both mixed effect model and PCA approaches to predict inhibition of photosynthetic yield indicated phytotoxicity could be predicted (P < 0.001) based upon the following parameters: C: N ratio; gilvin* and lignin-derived phenol content of DOM. Parallel proton-detected 1D and 2D NMR techniques showed that glucose anomers were the major constituents of fresh leachate. With ageing* glucose anomers disappeared and products of microbial transformation appeared* but there was no indication of the appearance of additional phytotoxic compounds. This suggests that reactive oxygen species may be responsible* at least partially* for DOM phytotoxicity. This study provides important new information highlighting the characteristics of DOM that link with phytotoxic effects.

D014326, Tropanes, 1, Early indicators of behavioral and physiological disturbances in Daphnia magna (Cladocera) induced by cyanobacterial neurotoxin anatoxin-a., The majority of reports on the toxic effect of cyanobacterial metabolites on the freshwater invertebrates is based on determination of two endpoints: mortality or immobilization. However* detection of sub-lethal effects requires more sensitive indicators The aim of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of digital-video analysis for determination of early behavioral and physiological responses in the assessment of effects caused by the cyanobacterial neurotoxin* anatoxin-a (ANTX) at a broad range of its concentration (0.5-50 μg/mL). Swimming speed (SS)* heart rate (HR)* oxygen consumption (OC)* thoracic limb activity (TLA) and abdominal claw movement (ACM) of Daphnia magna were evaluated. Swimming speed and abdominal claw movements were determined by digital analysis of video clips by Tracker® software; OC by Oxygraph Plus System® while HR* TLA and ACM by digital frame-by-frame analysis of video clips of microscopic view with the use of a media player software. The experimental study showed a concentration- and time-dependent decrease of SS* HR* OC* TLA and ACM. SS was inhibited as early as after 10 s of the exposure of Daphnia magna to ANTX* and the other physiological responses after 2 h. Further inhibition of these parameters was also noted after 24 h of the exposure. On the other hand* stimulation of ACM was noted at the lower (0.5 and 2.5 μg/mL) ANTX concentrations after both 2 h and 24 h of exposure. The results indicated that some behavioral and physiological biomarkers measured by video analysis may be a valuable tool for an early determination of toxic effects induced by cyanobacterial metabolites in zooplankters.

D002118, Calcium, 1, Ecotoxicity assessment of microcystins from freshwater samples using a bioluminescent cyanobacterial bioassay., The hepatotoxic cyanotoxins microcystins (MCs) are emerging contaminants naturally produced by cyanobacteria. Yet their ecological role remains unsolved* previous research suggests that MCs have allelopathic effects on competing photosynthetic microorganisms* even eliciting toxic effects on other freshwater cyanobacteria. In this context* the bioluminescent recombinant cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120 CPB4337 (hereinafter Anabaena) was exposed to extracts of MCs.

To investigate the efficacy of the Spirulina extract enriched for Braun-type lipoprotein (Immulina®) for breast cancer treatment* 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice were treated with 40 mg/kg Immulina® daily and the tumors' growth and metastasis were assessed. Also* CD4* CD8* and CD56 staining were performed to investigate the Immulina® effect on the immune cells' recruitment to the tumors by immunohistochemistry. Immulina® could significantly (P < 0.001) inhibit 4T1 breast tumors' growth. Immulina®-treated group exhibited a 63% decrease in the tumors' volume in comparison with control (P < 0.001). Also* Immulina® could significantly (P < 0.001) decrease metastatic burden at the vital organs as 68% and 61% decrease in the liver and lungs metastatic colonies were observed* respectively. Also* Immulina® could increase mean survival time of the tumor-bearing mice for 29 days. The Spirulina-treated mice tumors contained significantly more infiltrated NK* CD4+* and CD8+ T lymphocytes in comparison with control.

D004202, Disinfectants, 1, Simultaneous Microcystis algicidal and microcystin synthesis inhibition by a red pigment prodigiosin., Microcystis blooms and their secondary metabolites microcystins (MCs) occurred all over the world* which have damaged aquatic ecosystems and threatened public health. Techniques to reduce the Microcystis blooms and MCs are urgently needed. This study aimed to investigate the algicidal and inhibitory mechanisms of a red pigment prodigiosin (PG) against the growth and MC-producing abilities of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa).

D005659, Fungicides* Industrial, 1, The fungicide azoxystrobin promotes freshwater cyanobacterial dominance through altering competition., BACKGROUND: Sharp increases in food production worldwide are attributable to agricultural intensification aided by heavy use of agrochemicals. This massive use of pesticides and fertilizers in combination with global climate change has led to collateral damage in freshwater systems* notably an increase in the frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs). The precise mechanisms and magnitude of effects that pesticides exert on HCBs formation and proliferation have received little research attention and are poorly constrained. RESULTS: We found that azoxystrobin (AZ)* a common strobilurin fungicide* can favor cyanobacterial growth through growth inhibition of eukaryotic competitors (Chlorophyta) and possibly by inhibiting cyanobacterial parasites (fungi) as well as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Meta-transcriptomic analyses identified AZ-responsive genes and biochemical pathways in eukaryotic plankton and bacteria* potentially explaining the microbial effects of AZ. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the intertwined effects of a fungicide and eutrophication on microbial planktonic communities and cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic freshwater ecosystem. This knowledge may prove useful in mitigating cyanobacteria blooms resulting from agricultural intensification.

D009591, Nitrogenase, 1, Nitrogenase Inhibition Limited Oxygenation of Earth's Proterozoic Atmosphere., Cyanobacteria produced the oxygen that began to accumulate on Earth 2.5 billion years ago* at the dawn of the Proterozoic Eon. By 2.4 billion years ago* the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) marked the onset of an atmosphere containing oxygen. The oxygen content of the atmosphere then remained low for almost 2 billion years. Why? Nitrogenase* the sole nitrogen-fixing enzyme on Earth* controls the entry of molecular nitrogen into the biosphere. Nitrogenase is inhibited in air containing more than 2% oxygen: the concentration of oxygen in the Proterozoic atmosphere. We propose that oxygen inhibition of nitrogenase limited Proterozoic global primary production. Oxygen levels increased when upright terrestrial plants isolated nitrogen fixation in soil from photosynthetic oxygen production in shoots and leaves.

Specifically* we purified polysaccharides from Nostoc commune and two fractions of these polysaccharides are able to inhibit the proliferation and growth of five human CRC cell lines with divergent genetic backgrounds. Through activating NF-κB and AKT/JNK1/2 signaling pathways* one fraction of polysaccharides significantly activated macrophages* which was reflected by the enlarged size of macrophages* enhanced phagocytosis and expression of TNF-α and IL-1β. In summary* this study demonstrated that the polysaccharides from Nostoc commune Vaucher are a potent activator of macrophages* which subsequently contributes to the inhibition of CRC.
